# Example project with Django unit tests and GitHub actions

This web app has two pages, 

The welcoming home page http://127.0.0.1:8000/
The extremely accurate math page http://127.0.0.1:8000/two_plus_two 

Can you fix the code?

The tests are correct. They are failing because there are bugs in the code.  

Please fix the code, and send me a pull request.

Notice that there is a GitHub action that runs the tests, and displays information about passing and failing tests when a PR is created.
